Kernel Parameters (`/etc/sysctl.conf`)\n\n```bash\n# Network performance\nnet.core.rmem_max = 268435456\nnet.core.wmem_max = 268435456\nnet.core.netdev_max_backlog = 5000\nnet.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 32768 268435456\nnet.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 32768 268435456\nnet.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control = bbr\nnet.ipv4.tcp_fastopen = 3\n\n# Security hardening\nnet.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0\nnet.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0\nnet.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0\nnet.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts = 1\nnet.ipv4.icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses = 1\nkernel.dmesg_restrict = 1\nkernel.kptr_restrict = 2\n\n# Performance\nvm.swappiness = 1\nvm.dirty_ratio = 15\nvm.dirty_background_ratio = 5\nfs.file-max = 2097152\n```\n\n### 2. CPU Performance & Real-time\n\n```bash\n# Install CPU frequency scaling tools\nsudo apt install cpufrequtils\n\n# Set performance governor\necho 'GOVERNOR=\"performance\"' | sudo tee /etc/default/cpufrequtils\n\n# Disable CPU idle states for ultra-low latency\nsudo systemctl mask systemd-rfkill.service systemd-rfkill.socket\n\n# Real-time kernel (if needed)\nsudo apt install linux-lowlatency\n```\n\n### 3. Memory & Storage Optimization\n\n```bash\n# Huge pages for applications that support it\necho 'vm.nr_hugepages = 128' >> /etc/sysctl.conf\n\n# I/O scheduler optimization\necho 'ACTION==\"add|change\", KERNEL==\"sd[a-z]*\", ATTR{queue/scheduler}=\"mq-deadline\"' > /etc/udev/rules.d/60-ioschedulers.rules\n\n# Disable swap if you have enough RAM\nsudo swapoff -a\n# Comment out swap in /etc/fstab\n```\n\n## Application-Level Optimizations\n\n### 4. High-Performance Web Server (Nginx)\n\n```nginx\n# /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\nworker_processes auto;\nworker_rlimit_nofile 65535;\nworker_cpu_affinity auto;\n\nevents {\n    worker_connections 4096;\n    use epoll;\n    multi_accept on;\n}\n\nhttp {\n    sendfile on;\n    tcp_nopush on;\n    tcp_nodelay on;\n    keepalive_timeout 30;\n    keepalive_requests 1000;\n    \n    # Gzip compression\n    gzip on;\n    gzip_vary on;\n    gzip_min_length 1024;\n    gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript;\n    \n    # Buffer sizes\n    client_body_buffer_size 128k;\n    client_max_body_size 10m;\n    client_header_buffer_size 1k;\n    large_client_header_buffers 4 4k;\n    output_buffers 1 32k;\n    postpone_output 1460;\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Database Optimization (PostgreSQL example)\n\n```sql\n-- postgresql.conf optimizations\nshared_buffers = 256MB                 -- 25% of RAM\neffective_cache_size = 1GB             -- 75% of RAM\nwork_mem = 4MB\nmaintenance_work_mem = 64MB\ncheckpoint_completion_target = 0.9\nwal_buffers = 16MB\ndefault_statistics_target = 100\nrandom_page_cost = 1.1                 -- For SSDs\neffective_io_concurrency = 200         -- For SSDs\n```\n\n### 6.
